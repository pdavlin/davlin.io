                Hey, I'm {apiTest || "Patrick"}. You're at yet another web blog that might get
                updates sometimes.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Nebraska-based frontend developer. I love to build
                interesting experiences on the web. In my work I've been lucky
                to build large, sport-focused applications supporting millions
                of active users. I also love to build for home; I run a little
                stack of applications on a server in my office using a custom
                Docker and Traefik stack, which I'll eventually write about on
                this site.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm on a journey to learn more about web development without
                leaning so much on complex frameworks. That's why I built this
                little place on the web as a static-generated website instead of
                an interactive applicaiton. You can learn a bit more about what
                I'm into right now when I finish building my "now" page :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not super active on social media but I love to follow
                interesting accounts. Feel free to reach out to me on Mastodon!
