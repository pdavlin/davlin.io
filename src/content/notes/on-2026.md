My goal for 2026 is to start blogging. I've been trying to get into this for a while and thinking "hey, I have nothing to blog about" but that really isn't the case and hasn't been for a while. I've been writing on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/pdav) and feeling sort of inspired by an acquaintance who deleted her Instagram account to start blogging. This is a shot across the bow! I want to write at least a couple blogs a month in 2026 and I'm fixated on doing it.
