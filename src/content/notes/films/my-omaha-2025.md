![My Omaha poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/8/8/3/1/5/1288315-my-omaha-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3365ef3aaf)

Watched in a packed house during the Omaha premiere at Film Streams, followed by a brief Q&A session with Leo Louis and Nick Bealieu after the film.

I know Nick from college but to see his growth over a decade of following Leo Louis and spending time in North Omaha was a pretty special experience. This is also the first time I've ever seen a movie set in Omaha in an actual theater--at least one apartment building I've lived in was on screen! Several shots were filmed mere blocks from my last house! Pretty neat.

MY OMAHA highlights two kinds of divides, and neither is fully resolved by the end of the film. Nick's father does not become a progressive before his passing; Omaha's interstate system still divides its residents into two cities. The film imparts an understanding that the challenging first step toward harmony is finding a way to embrace people who don't agree with you, acknowledging their flaws and putting in the work to get them to see themselves more clearly. I didn't know who Leo Louis was before today, but MY OMAHA shows he's done that work well. Hope to continue following him in Omaha.

Ten years of work into MY OMAHA leaves you in the sensation that its impact far exceeds the documentary runtime. I think its weak point is that you can still tell that there's more Nick would like to say. Lots of sensitive conversations and family moments happen--rightly--off screen. Nick has certainly touched lives in Omaha, and that's made crystal clear by the people featured in MY OMAHA who came to the screening and spoke about how much they admired Nick's persistence and openness to their stories and perspectives. It's difficult to capture all that in one movie, and I certainly feel that my viewing was enhanced by having many of the people in the film there to lend their perspectives. It's a shame you can't include those kinds of testimonials in the complete product without looking tacky so you'll have to take my word for it.

Really enjoyed this; hope the next one is less difficult to produce because I'd like to see more from Nick soon.
