_This review may contain spoilers._

Will likely end up as a top three movie for me this year. A real joy to experience: funny, tense, fast-moving plot that doesn’t make you sit with anything for too long before it moves you on to the next plot point. Despite being nearly three hours long it avoids overstaying its welcome. Lots of great action cinematography.

Also as relevant to today’s political discourse as it is entertaining. Lots of people on my bsky feed catching the movie’s accurate portrayal of how gratingly vapid and shallow fascists are; you’ve never seen a movie villain walk more like a QWOP character and use more “boogaloo”-tier signal words.

I loved the equally timely critique of how age and complacency distance progressives from their younger counterparts. You get old and cynical, you focus on your immediate relationships instead of participating in causes, and you start to raise your eyebrows at the kids (as they jump over roofs like ninja turtles, lol, possibly overdetermined) but you can’t deny they’re putting the work in. The cycle continues.

Great performances throughout. Loved Greenwood’s understated, John Cage-inspired score for this one.
