Reminds me of all the best parts of _Uncut Gems_: a clockwork-precise series of misfortunes and absurdities so tense it makes you want to peel your face off. I think in general Marty is a lot more likable and easier to follow than Howard Ratner was, which made it easier to get invested in the story rather than just being horrified at it all.

The biggest part of what makes this movie work for me is Daniel Lopatin's score, giving it all this rich, wowy, synthy sound. It's simultaneously dreamy and terrifying, elevating each moment into something nearly mythical. It sort of perfectly writhes along with the story, at times pulsingly fast and at others incredibly shrill. I always felt that the _Uncut Gems_ score should've won an Oscar, so here's hoping he at least gets a nomination this time.

I went in blind to this one! Didn't know anything about it before sitting down. Great time at the movies.
