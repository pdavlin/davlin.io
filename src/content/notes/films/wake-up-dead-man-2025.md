I thought this was good! The KNIVES OUT-verse continues to impress with great ensemble casts and good performances from Craig, who always makes it feel like the solution falls in his lap. Hard for me not to feel connected to a Catholic resurrection storyline being played out as a murder mystery. Great costume work throughout!

It feels like Rian Johnson is very invested in making sure conservatives know he’s dunking on them and I worry that’s going to make these movies increasingly less fun to watch.
