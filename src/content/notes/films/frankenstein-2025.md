A very shiny and accessible (read: makes "subtext" into "text") take on Frankenstein that feels pretty responsive to 2024's NOSFERATU. Guillermo del Toro's preferred visual style is sort of uncanny to me; lots of the characters and scenery in this movie feels intensely plasticky and surreal. I enjoyed watching it but really felt strongly that it could've been a lot better with a bit more subtlety.
