![TRON: Ares poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/2/9/0/3/462903-tron-ares-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=a7c7de2bbc)

I was gonna write like ten paragraphs on this one but it simply isn’t that good so I’ll just say I think it’s unmistakable that this film about the beauty and righteousness of AI is made by the same company who recently licensed all their own content—Star Wars, Marvel, the whole crew—to OpenAI in a cynical gesture toward dominating an era of slop they pretend is inevitable. If tens or hundreds of inconsequential nonsense videos are going to be made of anything you’d better bet Disney thinks it should be their Property™ but this whole thing was so uninspired they should’ve just asked ChatGPT to generate it and saved $200M. Also Daft Punk did it better.
