Downton Abbey, the series, bills itself as an intertwined pair of shows, down to a negative-space title card: you get the lords and servants, the upper floors of the house and the lower floors, the rich and the poor, the house and the village, wartime and peacetime. The series itself reads, to me, as two cleanly separate _types_ of shows, cleaved at an inflection point after season 3, following a five-episode stretch where two core characters die, tragically. Downton's first three seasons trace the arc of a house deeply altered and changed by war, but following Matthew's death suddenly becomes a fairly feel-good show with neatly-tied bows on most storylines even within a single season. It would sort of be like if Game of Thrones became a soap opera after the Red Wedding.

The corresponding problem here is that Downton's upper class cast continues to expand while the servants are mostly left to twist in the wind with maybe one or two storylines at any given time. In some ways this both mirrors history--servant headcounts being downsized following a war and economic changes--and reflects a successful show doubling down on its strengths of costume and set design. It's still a fun watch, but undoubtedly a different show. You can't help but love these characters.

Still, I was cautious coming into the 2019 Downton Abbey movie because it's difficult not to see it as tacked on--too close to the end of a series to feel like a deliberate extension. Fortunately, at its best, the first Downton movie is really just a lovingly made, lavish standalone episode of the series. The costumes and set design finally get the sort of expensive cinematography and editing they deserve, as well as a very lush color grading that makes the movie feel quite grand. The royal family comes to Downton, some hijinks ensue, Maggie Smith delivers some funny quips, and questionable--even scandalous??--lineages are explored. It all ticks along nicely, as long as you're comfortable with the variety of thin reasons for all these characters to be back together, especially Mr. Carson, whose decision to retire at the end of the series served as a punctuation mark on the long grapple that Downton has with embracing change in 1920s Britain.

At its worst I think the movie tips these characters into deep Flanderized territory. Tom Branson continues in his role as an angel, who's always in the right place at the right time to dispense a perfect piece of advice to another character and salvage a relationship. Carson rejects his series storyline of finally surrendering to the modern world and comes back to enthusiastically to serve as butler again. Daisy, finally engaged to someone worth her while, finds herself needlessly in the middle of yet another love triangle. The rest of the servants? Barely addressed outside a thin storyline designed to make a punchline of poor Mr. Moseley. It's a challenging balancing act, I'm sure, to launch a cast of characters almost a decade in the making into a standalone movie that also needs to handhold newcomers. But it's also hard to be happy with how some characters end up in the film.

Maggie Smith remains the absolute star of this series, followed by Elizabeth McGovern and Jim Carter. It's hard to imagine a version of Downton without Smith in particular but obviously a movie got released this year after her death in 2024, so I know what I'm not looking forward to.
