A really funny scene in this movie is when the killer—narratively a terrifying slow moving and gruff fisherman—chooses to delay killing a character in a clothing store for several minutes so that he can cover himself with a plastic sheet, startle his target, trip on the plastic, and fall over, giving his victim like ten more minutes to get away.

Simultaneously a good film and a bad film. I had fun!
