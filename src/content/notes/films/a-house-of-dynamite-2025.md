![A House of Dynamite poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/2/7/8/7/1172787-a-house-of-dynamite-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9013364dac)

It's an interesting ensemble cast and generally speaking I like this style of layered storytelling (e.g., really loved it in Weapons) but I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that the major Point of this story is unresolved. Conceptually I understand that the message A House of Dynamite wants to portray is how difficult it is for military and political leadership to respond to events and I think it does a fairly good job of getting that right, but in reality history neither remembers nor cares about some of this stuff so much as "did they make the right call," which is fundamentally unanswerable when we don't know the outcome of the story.

I think there's a lot of talented acting in this one but man some of the accent work here is ROUGH and it was frequently pretty distracting to hear Jared Harris and Rebecca Ferguson--two very talented but distinctly not American actors-- try and hit beltway-operative accents and miss.
