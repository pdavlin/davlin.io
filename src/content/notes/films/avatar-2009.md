The first time I saw this film was in 3D, from the second row of the Council Bluffs IMAX theater the week of release. The experience of being that close to a giant, forced-perspective 3D movie (and the experience of vomiting in the bathroom afterwards) soured me pretty badly on AVATAR and on 3D films in general. I don't think I've seen it all the way through since. So when we got a new TV this year I was surprised to find myself with an urge to pull up this movie, at least to find an excuse to watch AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER afterward.

I spent at least half of the sixteen years since this film's release confidently stating that AVATAR is a movie which certainly impressed upon relief but which had no lasting cultural impact. Its story, essentially a well-worn blend of Pocahontas and Dune, didn't resonate with me when I was 14 and still doesn't really move the needle for me now. But there's no denying that Cameron's dedication to detail--in composition, staging, worldbuilding, and (my god) animation--elevates this otherwise fairly bland story into a near-masterpiece. Why is the story plain? Because these characters need to be archetypal and memorable to offset the overwhelming and disorienting visual feast the film throws at you all the time.

I was shocked how much of this movie I clearly remembered, and how each character's arc neatly slots into the film in ways that feel culturally coherent. Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang, in particular, play their two-sides-of-the-coin characters so precisely that I vividly recalled their deliveries of specific lines minutes before they happened on screen. I said, "You're not the only one with a gun, bitch," at the same time as Michelle Rodriguez.

I still understand this film's detractors. Hair sex remains really weird in a way that I don't think the movie was prepared to deal with. There's a discomfort in watching a nearly-perfect CGI effort stumble in the odd facial twitch or mocap quirk. The more time the Na'vi spend next to humans, the more obvious it becomes, especially when some of the military characters are so over-the-top animated in their facial expressions and movements. The movie depends on you not being able to notice it, but at the slightest fumble it completely pulled me out of the immersion.

Despite its expense, its gross, and its cast it somehow punches above its weight. I was pleasantly surprised.
