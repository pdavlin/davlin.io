watched across a few bike trainer sessions

Accomplishes what it sets out to do: tell a jaunty little story about some misfits. Without the additional mega story baggage it’s enjoyable enough to play during workouts.

Dinged several stars for telling two of the most tired superhero stories:

1. we tried to make Captain America, but it went sideways. As far as I can tell, a story hook that is the basis for at least a third of the MCU movies at this point. In this movie alone I’m counting three Captain America Misfits on the Thunderbolts fighting a fourth, who also embodies the next trope:
2. what if Superman sucked, kinda

Says a lot that even the unburdened marvel movies cannot shake this stuff, imo.
