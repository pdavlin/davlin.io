The “[marginalized people] as animals” metaphor for prejudice undermines the movie’s intended message so much that it almost feels like I’m missing something. Also someone very badly wants Americans to start using “clock tick” as a unit of time. Anyway several points in this one where I said “will anyone ever sing more beautifully than this????”
