Watched on the bike trainer.

Aside from making horny redditors happy, I don’t really know what actually happens in this movie. This California town is occupied by a handful of characters that interact, briefly, before most of them meet an untimely demise. If this is a series of coincidences, they’re not obvious ones. If any of these characters changes, it’s not in a particularly traceable way. Just a bunch of plot threads thrown together and shaken about to get a bunch of Hollywood celebs to drop observational humor on screen for 90 minutes.
