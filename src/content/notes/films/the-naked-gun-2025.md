Fairly funny throughout but I think it starts slightly better than it finishes. The charm of the original movie is mostly in its prop comedy and to the extent that they use it I think the CGI sort of muddles the humor for me. It’s definitely at its best when it’s meandering—the slow parts of the movie were all when it was “on topic.”
