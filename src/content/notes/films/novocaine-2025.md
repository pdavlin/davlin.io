Took three sessions of bike training to get through this one.

Clever enough even if I think the trend of "look at this dweeb, what if he was an action star" movies advanced by this and THE AMATEUR is a little lame. Some good gags driven by the "no pain" bit but the thing all the movies trying to emulate JOHN WICK don't get right about the original movie's formula is that it got into the action almost right away. Almost 30 minutes in this one before anyone gets shot! Way too long!!

As a side note I think it's funny that this movie was clearly trying to hit the DIE HARD-is-a-Christmas-movie release window by being set during the holidays but clearly got bumped to March instead.
