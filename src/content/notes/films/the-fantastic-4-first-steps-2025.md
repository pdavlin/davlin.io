Watched on bike trainer during workouts.

I'll start by saying that the plot point in this movie that requires the most suspension of disbelief is that 100% of New Yorkers in any universe would willingly leave for any reason. There's an alternate universe Carrie Bradshaw who was crushed by Galactus in her brownstone.

Otherwise: I think it's the best Marvel film in at least five years, which isn't saying a lot but hopefully is a step toward breaking this franchise's slump. It has a great visual language and sense of place (which I'm sure they'll remove in the next movie when they merge with the greater storyline). I think the core group has pretty good chemistry. I'm an Ebon Moss-Bachrach fan just in general but I like The Thing as like a Neighborhood Guy you just see around.

A couple things are simply too cynical to ignore. Robert Downey Jr. shouldn't still be in this franchise. Much of the humor in the movie is carried conceptually by "What if we ported R2-D2 to the MCU?" and it falls flat for me. The CGI Garner Surfer is really uncanny and kind of scary.

It's a good enough movie. I think the superhero movie industry would be far better off writing these as self-contained stories without baggage.
