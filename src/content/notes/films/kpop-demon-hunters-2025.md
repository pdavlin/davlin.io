I was a bit concerned that Sony Animation would be pigeonholed by the Spiderverse films, so it was nice to see that they can work across different visual styles while very much keeping their own obvious in-house vibe. Really snappy and crisp animation, good songs, charming enough. Caught myself thinking "maybe I'll listen to some K-pop" but ended up not doing that, which means this movie is a FAILURE
