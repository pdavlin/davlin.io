The John Wick series continues to be the friendly home of relatively uncharismatic actors. As usual there are some pretty creative action setpieces here--they're doing things with grenades, in particular, that really blew me away (aha ha ha)--but this format is undeniably getting a little stale. Feels like this series really wants to be come a [name]iverse franchise, but the inner machinations of the continental hotels and the variously racist criminal organizations simply aren't that interesting and don't hold up very well under scrutiny. I mean, who on earth is paying to stay at these hellhole hotels other than assassins? Don't the assassins keep killing each other, in the hotels? You're telling me they run a hotel chain for a customer base that is dead set on wiping itself out?

Anyway the moment you see Keanu here you know he's gonna duke it out with Ana de Armas and I think it's cool to have him pop in as a real force of nature from an outside perspective but his interactions with the main character feel pretty forced and the reason he walks away is pretty flimsy.

One thing I'll say for this franchise is that it knows what it's for--who cares about the story or the actors as long as the cinematography is cool, the color grading is insane, and the set pieces drop my jaw. I enjoyed this for what it was and even though it's getting stale I'll probably continue to watch as many of these as they're going to continue pumping out.
