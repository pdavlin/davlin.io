![Downton Abbey: A New Era poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/6/7/7/9/736779-downton-abbey-a-new-era-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=0a6f24659f)

Downton's second film is defined both in plot and themes by Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith), so it's the movie's biggest sin that she isn't on screen for nearly enough time. It makes the curious decision to split the crew into two completely separate storylines, one far away in France, in order to bring on a handful of newcomers to replace the growing list of notably missing characters from the original show.

Once again, it feels like an especially lavish interpretation of what the show laid down. The vibrant colors of the French villa are pleasant, as is the attention to set design that makes the villa feel so fresh compared to Downton. I also noticed the music in the film a bunch of times, and really appreciated it.

I complained In the review of Downton Abbey (2019) that characters are really just a series of walking callbacks to themselves, and that continues in A New Era. At this point Mary's character arc is a smoldering heap and she has really nothing to do except be The New Violet, and the movie really leans on this as a plot point. Violet's season 5 arc in the show and storyline in this movie revolve around the mysteries and questions of her interactions with suitors while married to Robert's father. The show treats this as prehistorical--by design, you don't _really_ know, and that's ok. But in order to tie Mary to Violet, thematically, and firmly declare her as Violet's successor at the end of the film, Mary apparently needs to be separated from her husband and engaged in a will-they-won't-they relationship with a new suitor. With only the servants on her half of the storyline, she's not really doing very much work interacting with characters from the original show, so she is mostly played against the cast of newcomers, almost none of whom are actually worth mentioning.

The Robert/Cora/Tom/Edith storyline is similarly mid-tier, rehashing a bunch of specific plot points about illness and questionable parentage from the show as a means to create tension. It's not very interesting and I don't know whether I agree with the choice to try and edit these two storylines together in a single film.

I did cry when Violet died at the end of the film so I guess despite my issues I'm still as invested in these characters and this story as I have been over the past couple months that Zoe and I have devoured the show. Still not looking forward to the next movie without Maggie Smith.
