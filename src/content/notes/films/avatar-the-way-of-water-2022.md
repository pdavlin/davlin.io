Perhaps the most important thing I knew about this movie going in was that it is defined largely by its unbelievably long thirteen-year development time. AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER wears this on its sleeve like a badge, because in every respect the term I'd use to describe this effort is "painstaking."

On a technical level it's hard to believe this _only_ took thirteen years to make. Imagining the amount of time and literal energy spent rendering some of these scenes makes my head spin. Watching the Na'vi underwater, freshly out of water, riding whales, crying, basking in sunsets--all feels real in a way that makes real life inadequate. Any imperfections in Cameron's CGI process have been ironed out, and what's left is an unbelievably polished effort that almost defies comprehension. The only exception is when Spider is on-screen; his physical acting is excellent and is the only visual indication that the Na'vi aren't real, because there's still a visceral element about human movement that the computers still can't perfectly replicate. But it's closer than its ever been. The visual excellence of this is combined with a great score and very good worldbuilding that makes it a real delight to watch. I love when it dallies, its lilting cadence that gives you a bit of action chased with like a solid half hour of beautiful, impossible underwater cinema. I could spend forever on Pandora.

AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER, like its predecessor, is let down by its narrative. First, it suffers from what I might refer to as the SCOOBY-DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED problem, which is to say that it tries to turn an existing (if barebones) storyline into a family movie with an arc for everyone. No element of this story is unexpected, in part because you just can't take that kind of risk on a movie this expensive in the 2020s. In a lot of ways the story mirrors the original AVATAR perfectly; Jake Sully needs to find a way to prove he belongs in a tribe of foreigners such that he can band them together to fight the capitalist regime bent on profits. This time, his kids are on the journey and each on their own coming-of-age arcs. The tropes will continue until morale improves, I guess, and I don't think it's all bad, but it's all very congruent with lots of global-market movies in a way that feels obvious.

The most pressing problem with the second film is that its story feels completely subservient to retaining the entire original cast in a way that really bugs me. Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang's characters both return from the dead, as Na'vi, in ways that erase the third act of the original film and which defy comprehension even in the bounds of the story being told. I don't think this film series is capable of active cynicism but whatever's going on with Weaver's CGI as a teenage Na'vi is... unpleasant, and I think it actively makes the film worse. Narratively, I think it also suffers from its own franchise; I'm so trained on movies like Marvel that I had a pretty explicit understanding of how this movie would set up the finale, and the "who's in/who's out" dynamics of setup films like this one feel played out.

Still, I'm glad I got to watch this one before the trilogy ends. Excited for FIRE & ASH this month. Here's hoping the beautiful journey continues.
