A 3.5-hour exercise in pushing the boundaries both in terms of visual splendor and my patience with this story. Worth the trip to see in in IMAX.

Visuals first: the 3D really adds something to this film that makes it come to life. There’s still this sense of realer-than-real immersion about Pandora that defies belief. I don’t know whether there was a Great Leap Forward here like between Avatar and The Way Of Water but when it works it all combines to truly fantastical effect. The additional 3D perspective keeps the battle scenes from feeling cluttered.

All conclusions have to eventually grapple with the sins of the preceding story entries. Over the three-movie storyline it’s clear that Jake and Neytiri’s arc focuses on growing into an embrace of exceptionalism and otherness instead of straining to fit in. The Sully family’s misfortune is always downstream of a discrete choice to fit a square peg into a round hole. The manifestation of this is mostly that the kids in The Way Of Water and Fire and Ash are always Extremely Correct, operating with a complete moral clarity that the adults lack. This internal family conflict becomes grating in part because its notes are obvious.

The corresponding problem ends up being that by the midway point of this movie the entire family is composed of various living Chekhov’s guns and/or MacGuffins, all layered with about as many biblical references as you can fit into a 3.5 hour movie. At that point it felt a lot like the third Pirates of the Caribbean, a movie famously and culturally panned for its complex web of shifting agreements and alliances. There are so many characters here—many of them underdeveloped, especially the Ash People—that nobody really gets a fully sensible arc here. At some point, all the characters cleanly and directly fall on either side in a perfectly good-vs-evil conflict. There's so much pent-up comeuppance being delivered that I actually don't know what happened to Varang, in the end. The film ultimately robs itself by having Quaritch's arc end as it does. And there's no epilogue; no falling action for these characters that lets us understand how its universe goes on.

It's all fine. I'm glad I watched it in a theater! But if there are more of these hopefully they can find a new and better arc.
