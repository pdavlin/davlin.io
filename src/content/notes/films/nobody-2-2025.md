We've reached the zenith of the John Wick-style action movie. This is an uncomplicated, corporatized, by-the-numbers action movie with no stakes, clear sides, and zero ambiguity. Its violence asks nothing of you. All its plot points are communicated well in advance, and it attempts to stick in a bunch of emotional beats that neither make sense contextually nor say anything interesting about the characters. Skip it!
